Mandelbrot Set Code
This code generates an image of the Mandelbrot set, which is a famous fractal in complex dynamics. The code uses OpenMP to parallelize the computation, which can significantly reduce the execution time for large images by distributing the work across multiple cores or processors.

Introduction
The Mandelbrot set is a 2D grid of points in the complex plane, which can be represented as an image by assigning colors to each point based on the number of iterations required to exceed the modulus of 2. The formula z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c is iterated for each point c, until either the modulus of z exceeds 2 or a maximum number of iterations is reached. The resulting image is written to a file in the PPM format.

Parallelization
The code uses OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop over the pixel coordinates. The variables that are shared between threads (pixels) are marked as shared, while the variables that are private to each thread (i, j, iter, x, y, zx, zy, zx2, zy2, cx, cy, k, nthreads) are marked as private.

Performance
The performance of the code can be improved by optimizing the algorithm and using more efficient data structures, such as a quadtree to represent the complex plane. However, the use of OpenMP can provide a significant speedup on multicore systems, especially for large images. To compare the performance of the serial and parallel implementations, the execution time can be measured for a given set of input parameters, such as the image size and maximum number of iterations.
