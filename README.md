# Optimizing_Classical_Sorting_by_OpenMP
### Task

1.Random generation of an array with double-precision floating-point numbers;

2.A serial solution for each sorting algorithm to sort the generated array;

3.A parallel solution for each sorting algorithm to sort the array with OpenMP on CPU;

4.A report to explain all processes.
